## timer.py
Buttons on the Galactic Unicorn itself...

A) Reset and start timer.

B) Stop timer and store current time.

C) If you have pressed (B) it will show the stored time, otherwise it will default to 00:00:00::00 and show that.

FYI when you are using this script and restore, it will display hundredths of a second in the restored state but when you are running the timer it will not since it messes up the UI. 

D) Show the clock.
